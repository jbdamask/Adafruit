Purpose: Simple code to interact with my Adafruit Flora over a connected Adafruit Flora Bluefruit LE component. 
         I have the controller programmed with other code from this repo that listens to UART.RX for "RED", which 
        changes the onboard NeoPixel to red, and writes GREEN to UART.TX when a sensor is touched. 
        This javascript code inverts TX and RX so it can write "RED" to UART.TX and listens to UART.RX via
        the characteristic's "notify" property.
Synopsis: $ node install
          $ node noble_uart.js
