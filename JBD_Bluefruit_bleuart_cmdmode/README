Purpose: Prototyping
Function: This code configures Flora and Flora Bluefruit LE to communicate
          with each other and the Bluefruit LE Connect iOS app. The 
          ultimate goal is to test using adafruit.io with MQTT to change the
          color of the on board NeoPixel. The iOS app is the conduit.
Notes:  Adafruit.io configuration
        1) Connect, etc
        2) Create feeds thing1, thing2
        iOS app configuration
        1) Connect to Bluefruit LE using mode UART
        2) Press MQTT
        3) Enter server, port, user, key
        4) Publish UART RX: <name>/feeds/thing1 (At least once)
        5) Subscribe: <name>/feeds/thing2 (At least once); Action: Transmit
        With this configured, I can connect using Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor
        and any AT+ command I send will turn the on board NeoPixel to green. Then
        from adafruit.io feed thing2, I can Create Data and if I use the
        word RED, the NeoPixel will turn red.
