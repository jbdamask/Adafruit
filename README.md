# Adafruit
Repo for messing around with Adafruit goodies
Basically a small amount of good stuff mixed in with troves of NOOB junk.

As of May 10, 2016 the code I'm most interested in is JBDBluefruit_Touch_MQTT. This is a working version of how to communicate using NeoPixel colors over MQTT. Adafruit.io is the broker, iPhone app is the gateway and my devices use Flora Bluefruit LE as peripherals.
